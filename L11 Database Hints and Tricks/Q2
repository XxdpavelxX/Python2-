Question 2:

What function of the mysql.connector module must you call to establish a connection with a database?

Question 3:

If the built-in zip() function is given two lists of unequal length as arguments, what is the result?

Your Answer:
It returns a list that is truncated in length to the length of the shortest argument sequence. 

Returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences
or iterables. The iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.
