Question 1:

How do you add a menu bar to a Tkinter root window?

Your Answer:
To add a menu bar to a window, instantiate a Menu widget with the window as its parent, and configure it as the window's menu item. "menubar" is the empty menu created in the example below.

from tkinter import *

class App(Frame):
    def __init__(self, master):
        Frame.__init__(self, master)
        self.grid()
        self.widgets()
    def widgets(self):
        menubar = Menu(root)            
        root.config(menu=menubar)
        
root=Tk()
app=App(root)
root.mainloop()


Question 2:

How do you add a file menu to the menu bar?

Your Answer:
You can add a pulldown Menu widget to the window's menu bar using the menu bar as its master and calling its add_cascade() method. Finally, you add choices to the pulldown using the pulldown's add_command() method. 

        filemenu = Menu(menu)
        menu.add_cascade(label="File", menu=filemenu)
        
root = Tk()
app = Application(master=root)
app.mainloop()



Question 3:

How do you add an "Open" command to the file menu that calls function f when the command is selected by the user?

Your Answer:
By following what we did in menudemo.py. you can add a pulldown Menu widget to the window's menu bar using the menu bar as its master and calling its add_cascade() method. Finally, you add choices to the pulldown using the pulldown's add_command() method. 

eg
filemenu = Menu(menu)
menu.add_cascade(label="File", menu=filemenu) 
filemenu.add_command(label="Open", command=self.f)
