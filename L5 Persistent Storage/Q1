Question 1:

What does the statement pickle.dump(o, f) do?

Your Answer:
It serializes the object o and stores/writes it in the file f.


Question 2:

Should pickle files be opened in text or binary mode?

Your Answer:
Pickle files should be opened in binary mode so the interpreter doesnt modify the contents.

Be sure to always open pickle files created with protocols >= 1 in binary mode. For the old ASCII-based pickle protocol 0 you can use either text mode or binary mode as long as you stay consistent.

A pickle file written with protocol 0 in binary mode will contain lone linefeeds as line terminators and therefore will look â??funnyâ?? when viewed in Notepad or other editors which do not support this format.

Question 3:

What type of key values does the shelve module require you to use?

Your Answer:
The key values must be encodable as strings.
