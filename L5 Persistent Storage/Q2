Question 2:

What persistent format would you recommend if the data must be read by JavaScript as well as Python programs?

Your Answer:
I would recommend the JSON serialization format.

JSON has become an important protocol / format with the advent of AJAX i.e. web pages that update without needing to be reloaded (example gmail).  Python typically resides on the server and talks to JavaScript browsers.  The
primitive data types are communicable in both directions thanks to JSON.

XML is another client-server transmission format understood across 
languages.  We should remember that HTML itself is close to an XML and may be served in strict XML format as a mimetype.

What expression will serialize object x as an equivalent JSON string?

Your Answer:
json.dumps(x)
