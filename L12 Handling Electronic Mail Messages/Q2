Question 1:

What separates the body of a message from its headers?

Your Answer:
Two consecutive CRLFs separate an email's headers from its body.

"""
Most textual Internet protocols (including HTTP, SMTP, FTP, IRC and many others) mandate the use of ASCII CR+LF
(0x0D 0x0A) on the protocol level, but recommend that tolerant applications recognize lone LF as well. In practice,
there are many applications that erroneously use the C newline character '\n' instead (see section Newline in programmin
languages below). This leads to problems when trying to communicate with systems adhering to a stricter interpretation of
the standards; one such system is the qmail MTA that actively refuses to accept messages from systems that send bare LF 
instead of the required CR+LF.[3]
